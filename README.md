Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Suricata - Configuration, Setup, and Monitoring.
# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) with Suricata

This repository contains the setup and configuration for implementing a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Suricata. Suricata is an open-source threat detection engine capable of real-time intrusion detection (IDS), inline intrusion prevention (IPS), and network security monitoring (NSM).

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To deploy Suricata as a NIDS to monitor network traffic and detect potential threats in real-time.
- **Technologies Used**: Suricata, Linux (Ubuntu/Debian or CentOS/Fedora).
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time traffic analysis and monitoring.
  - Customizable rules to detect various types of network threats.
  - Multi-threaded performance to handle large volumes of traffic.
  - Protocol-based traffic inspection for deep packet analysis.

## Installation and Configuration

### Step 1: Install Suricata

#### For Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oisf/suricata-stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install suricata
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
    Example configuration:
af-packet:
  - interface: eth0
    threads: 4
    cluster-id: 99
    cluster-type: cluster_flow
    defrag: yes

vars:
  address-groups:
    HOME_NET: "[192.168.1.0/24]"
    EXTERNAL_NET: "!$HOME_NET"
sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i eth0
sudo tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log
sudo suricata-update
sudo systemctl restart suricata

### Explanation:
- **Installation and Configuration**: The steps are clearly laid out for installing Suricata on different Linux distributions.
- **Monitoring Alerts**: Simple instructions are provided to monitor and view real-time alerts generated by Suricata.
- **Updating Rules and Maintenance**: Users are encouraged to keep their rules updated, which is crucial for effective threat detection.
- **Contributing**: An open invitation for others to contribute to the project, fostering community involvement.
- **License**: Specifies the licensing terms under which the project is shared.

This `README.md` provides a comprehensive guide for users to understand and deploy Suricata as a NIDS effectively.
